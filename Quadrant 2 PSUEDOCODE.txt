		get pixels weighted value by multiplying BW value with -weight/(num White pixels) //weights are bunched by 5 pixels (ie first five pixels have weight of -32, next five have -31, etc); divide position (weight) by number of white pixels to normalise the error value due to width of white line

get error value by adding all pixel weighted values together
get ratio to change speeds from error value //(ratio is max possible error (3200) divided by error for the increased speed side)

while (error value is above or below ___){ //margin values can be slightly higher/lower than 0 (ie 5 pixels either side of middle)
	Change speed of left and right motors by ratio
