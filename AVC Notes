Motor 2 is the slow motor (right motor)

Motor 1 is left at -100
Motor 2 is right at -175
At these values, bot will go straight
So the right motor is off by a factor of 75...

Wiring makes it so that negative values move the robot forward

Makes 90 degree turn to the right - Apply for maze
Motor 1 : -175
Motor 2: 175
